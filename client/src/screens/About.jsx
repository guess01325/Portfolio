      <p>
        I’m an intuitively driven, passionate, and disciplined Software Engineer with a strong background in customer service. I’m known for my sincerity, integrity, and ability to connect with people. I take pride in doing my best in every project and consistently delivering top-notch service with everything I do.

      <p>
        My life experiences — from working with customers to mentoring young adults in ministry — along with a lifelong commitment to growth and learning, have uniquely equipped me for success. I work well with people, manage projects efficiently, and have developed the technical skills needed to bring ideas to life. I’m excited to contribute these strengths to your company or project and would be a valuable asset to whatever you’re aiming to accomplish.
